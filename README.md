# mazerace_app

MazeRace is a simple maze game in which the mouse must reach the cheese. It was originally developed to work with OpenEarable—an open-source, Arduino-based platform for ear-based sensing applications—which requires a special headset to allow the player to control the game using head movements. In this version, head-movement controls have been replaced with on-screen buttons for simpler gameplay.
